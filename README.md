# secret-santa
A small scale project to automate Secret Santa between your friends. 
At the moment, the santa automater has the ability to parse through a .csv file which contains a list of student names and forms random pairings of the gifters and the giftees. Upon assigning the pairs, an email system has been programmed in order to deliver an email to the sender of the gift with the details of the person they would be gifting with their address.
